                            <h2> Why You Need Continuous Training to Stay Relevant </h2>
                            <p> It is becoming evident that job acquisition, retention, and developing a lucrative career in each profession does not sorely depends on just graduating and getting a degree or certificate,
                                 even if one is graduating with a first class and is honored with a doctorate degree. 
                                 It is also primitive for employers and executives to think that the goals and objectives of their organizations can be achieved by the earlier mentioned individuals. 
                                 That is why there is need for continuous training to stay relevant in the professional world. </p>
                                 <br>
                                 <p> According to Manpower group employment outlook survey, published on September 14, 2021, 69% of employers globally are struggling to find skilled workers, 
                                     especially in high-demand areas like Operations and Logistics, Manufacturing and Production, IT, Sales, and Marketing.   </p>
                                     <br>
                                     <p> Are you surprised at the statistics considering the rate at which we have people graduating from numerous universities globally? 69% of employers are still struggling to find skilled workers. What could be the cause of this skill gap? Is it that the graduates are not well taught? That is certainly not the cause. It all falls back to the lack of continuous training.

                                        In this article, we will be identifying some reasons why continuous training is needed to stay relevant in the employment industry. But first let's get few facts concerning continuous training. </p>
                                        <br>
                                        <p> Continuous training is the process of acquiring new skills and knowledge continually over time (or ‘Upskilling’). You might also hear the term ‘lifelong learning’, which is a similar concept but usually refers to personal development, rather than work-related development. Continuous and lifelong learning can take many different forms – everyone learns differently. From evening classes at your local university to bite-size learning or online courses, training can be seen in two-fold;

                                            Employers training- This is a training that involves executives and CEO to improve in their managerial function and strategic decision making.
                                            Employees training -This is a systematic method of learning and development with the purpose of enhancing the efficiency of an individual, a group, or an organization (Goldstein & Ford, 2002).
                                            Continuous training involves the use of various methods that can be classified as synchronous or asynchronous learning models. Synchronous learning refers to the training approach where employees learn under the guidance of an instructor whether in a traditional classroom setting or when taking a virtual course. Asynchronous learning, on the other hand, is when employees work independently and at their own pace.
                                            
                                            Another approach combines these two models called blended or hybrid learning (CompTIA, 2020). </p>
                                            <br>
                                            <p> used to be a cumbersome time-consuming process due to the limited resources available for carrying out the process with a lot of effort and less productivity. But thanks to advancement in energy auditing software’s and technologies, the process has become more faster, easier, and accurate giving a better result and yielding more in terms of service delivery. But before those software’s and technologies can be integrated in any organization there need to be trained personnel to handle them.

                                                Utilizing them goes beyond employing electrical engineers to operate them, because of the recent innovations and advancement in technologies those engineers will need to be trained in line the current change and transformation in technologies for them to be utilized and be more productive in their audits.
                                                
                                                In the year 2019, Max Migold Limited conducted a training on energy to their Electrical Engineers to ensure that they can operate and make use of the new Audit technology called Eniscope that the company integrated into their Auditing process. And that has greatly increased the company’s service delivery when it comes to Energy audit. The efficiency of the team increased drastically.  </p>
