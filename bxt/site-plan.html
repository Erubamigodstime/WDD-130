        <p>one of the economic problems faced in the world today is a high rate of unemployment especially among youth,
            and this is not just because of the unavailability of Jobs
            but graduates and individual not skilled enough for set roles.
            At BXT Academy Our goal with the website is to upskill the general public/ job seekers and make them
            qualified for whatever role in variety of field,
            to create a learning platform for those that are employed to improve and transform their career through
            series of comprehensive trainings and skills acquisition in variety of field.

            Would you want to remain stagnant in knowledge in this world that is transforming rapidly with innovations,
            technology and much more?
            The website is also aimed to create entrepreneurs out of our youth and make them self-employed rather than
            mere job seekers.
            and this we are certain we can achieve because vast knowledge, learning tools and years of experience among
            the c suites, executives and labor market.
