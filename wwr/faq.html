            <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages.
                We have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall
                (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).

                <p> â€œOur 4 day rafting trip can be summed up in two words: AWE-SOME!!!! There was absolutely nothing
                    else you could have done to make it better.
                    Tyler was super in every aspect of putting up with six greenhorns. He was knowledgeable, friendly,
                    patient, informative, a great cook, humorous, and concerned about our safety.
                    I will make it my mission to tell everyone I know who even has the slightest notion that they might
                    want to go on a rafting trip to contact Echo Canyon before they do anything else </p>

                <p> had never been white water rafting before, and knew really nothing about what was involved with it
                    before going on this trip, heck, I don't even know how to swim!
                    All of the guides had a very relaxed but confident and professional personality with the groups, and
                    our guide, Christie, was no exception. She was absolutely phenomenal! She exuded a sense of calm and
                    zen that instantly quieted any nerves I had about the experience
